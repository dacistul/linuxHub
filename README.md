Airflow and Thermal Management Linux Kernel Module for Computer Systems

My project comprises of a microcontroller that connects to both the computer and the added fans within the computer case. A kernel module facilitates communication between the microcontroller and the computer, while a dedicated program enables the microcontroller to control the fans. This design ensures that it is both cost-effective and easy to implement, making it accessible for users seeking to enhance their system's cooling performance without incurring significant expenses.
